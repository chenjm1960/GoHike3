# GoHike3
an app for hikers, walkers and maybe runners
Stage one of building this app is to get all the features working. Features such as map display, information display and lastly, the design look.
Currently, the Map display is working. The map displays the 2D and 3D views. And also displays the standard, hybrid and salellite views.
The 'speed bar' has also been built and is working. This speed bar allows the user to quickly visulize his/her walking or running speed. The speed bar uses the app data for speed and plots it out in the bar chart; which is updated every 1 sec.
The next feature will be weather display which will use the weather api to display the current weather.
lastly, the app design will take place to make this app as Apple compliant as possible. It is desired that this hiking/walking/running app be as pleasent and simple to utilize as possible.
